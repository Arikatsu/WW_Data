What the chimpanzee was holding in his hand was exactly what the plantain plant named XXX looked like in the image documents. It was recorded that this fruit, popular among both young and old, had been widely cultivated before the Lament.\nHowever, as a triploid plant, XXX, like most cash crop plants that require breeding techniques, disappeared after the Lament. Information about this fragile species can now be found in some historical literature.\nAlthough regretable this is also the natural law of succession. According to Verina's law, stagnation is one of the most important factors of biological extinction, and this is the inevitable end of XXX in the wild, which has been artificially deprived of its ability to reproduce."

However, the origin of the wonderful purple color on the leaves is unknown, and further research is needed to verify it.\nThe large tree is perennially cooped up with parenting female orangutans underneath, which makes them sensitive and rabid. To avoid a head-on confrontation, I plucked a large amount of gorilla hair through days of collecting and making it a coat. By such means, I took and effort to get close enough to the big tree and collected samples of some of the leaves.\nHowever, because of the season, no samples of the flowers as well as the fruits of the species were collected, and no pollinating insects were seen in the vicinity. There are still many mysteries to be revealed.\nBut I am sure that this is the first time this species is discovered. I tentatively named it XXX and made an appointment with it to come back sometime to hear its story of more than a century.\nGoodbye, XXX and I'll see you again when the season is right."

Its presence seemed to indicate the infinite power of life, and I and Xxx were attracted by its vitality like then afternoon sun. We were involuntarily leaping and cheering.\nBut the closer we get to the tree, the more anxious the plants sound. Even the duckweed beneath the feet are making strange noises.\nI rarely find this phenomenon outside the radiation range of Tacet Fields. Finding the source of this phenomenon may be lead to the reason why the trees throughout the Dim Forest, both the Confinement Woods and the Xxx just now are so huge.\nSo what am I waiting for? It's better to get up and go now than to sit and talk!"

It chased me from the Confinement Woods all the way here before I could get rid of it.\n\nBut this is already near the Tacet Field, with soil barren and the plants left with only sounds of pain. There is nothing I can do for plants in this state. I have to cheer up! Decay and extinction are also part of ecology. Nature is not always gentle, and it is my duty to detect and witness it."

        "Content": "The environment of the Confinement Woods is even more magical than expected. A unique canopy ecosystem has formed around the branches of this giant tree.\nAccording to my investigation, the tree's branches contain abundant Resonance Energy within. The energy gathered from around the area of the Dim Forest travels from the top of the tree to the entire trunk. Under the catalyst of this energy, such a huge tree was formed. And it is by relying on these energies that the tree reproduces a whole different ecosystem. Probably because of the ferocious roars that come from time to time within the tree, the tree has no signs of activity from large MO or TD. This gives the plants a better chance to flourish and allows the Remnant Mutterfly to exist.\nThe skills of the Resonator who created this giant tree is very similar to mine. I guess he is also a nature lover. Otherwise, even with the assistance of the sonic instrument at the top of the tree, it is unlikely that such a large and complex giant tree could have been created.\nIn order to facilitate future expeditions, I made a little fluorescent decoration on the branch of Confinement Woods as a sign. This will make future research expeditions more efficient. So it's time to go, to explore the depths of the Confinement Woods!"

        "Content": "Author: Yanshu\nSince the beginning of the \"TD Wave\" (Years 130-155 ), the fog in the Hazy Depths located at the bottom of the Hukou, the Tiger's Maw, has increased dramatically, and the Academy has detected a large number of Wutheron activity signals at this location.\nThe purpose of this exploration is to continue to investigate the fog, and to rescue the people trapped inside. Members are as follows:\nSpecial Operations Company, Vanguard Battalion, Huanglong Midnight Rangers Regiment (111162)\nGeological Exploration Team, Huaglong Academy\n......\nAnalysis of Results Regarding the Investigation of the Unknown Fog:\nThis exploration collected samples of the mists in the tunnel connecting the Hukou Mine and the Hazy Depths, and analyzed them in the field using the [Simple Spectrometer] carried by the team. Based on the results of this test, we speculate that the mist appears to be a biological component, with a composition similar to the scale powder on the wings of lepidopteran insects, showing non-toxic, low-temperature properties.\nWe infer that the danger of the mists come from its low temperature:\n\u2460\tCondensation of water vapor due to low temperatures can greatly impede vision and cause investigators to lose judgment of direction in the foggy area.\n\u2461\tLow temperatures can directly affect the health status of investigators, prolonged hypothermia leads to reduced physical vitality and the inability to respond to hazards in a timely manner.\nHowever, our current investigation has not yet identified the anomalous sound coming from within the fogs proper, and considering that the unknown sound may lead to panic among the people nearby and affect the operations of the mine, it is recommended that the above information be withheld from the public.\n\nBelow is the personnel missing recently:\nChameng\nKuopu\nLeyun\nSongning\n......\n(Relatives to these persons experienced imaginary voices to various degrees. The contents of the voices are summonings to enter the Hazy Depths at the bottom of the mine. It is suspected that these voices concern the anamolies in the mists. Further investigation is currently impossible due to the lockdown of the Depths. All staff is advised to avoid mists and suspend mining works around the Hazy Depths."

However, because the linkage was too strong, \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 was unable to sever it on his own, and the other team members forcibly awakened \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 while calming \u25a0. After completing the report log, \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 experienced hallucinations, blurred consciousness, and loss of consciousness, and lost vital signs an hour later.\nThe \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 Intercity Metro Station was assessed to be extremely dangerous and was placed on lockdown for cleanup immediately, with all \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 team survivors subject to special observation."

The train FUTURE was used to carry the elite group in the \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 city at the time to evacuate the hardest-hit areas, and because of the limited capacity for passengers, a large number of civilians of lower social group were stranded in the waiting area and a massive clash occurred. The famous pianist \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 on the train decided to get off the train in solidarity with the other civilians and began playing on the spot in the VIP waiting area. The sound of his piano calmed the crowd and echoed the cries of the people.

It cost them a wretching price to turn the tide in which human had been only passively defending, into one that will promise Huanglong's ultimate victory.\nIn our deepest memories the 306 warriors left in the battle of Tides of Beasts are mourned and monumented at this cemetery.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                ALL MEN OF HUANGLONG\n\nP.

The battle progressed as follows:\nIn late November, the enemy assaulted our 9.17 highland, which was not named. For days of nights of fighting and contending, most of the surface of the highland was occupied by the enemy. On October 27, we received the command to go in to battle and back up friendly forces.\nUnder fire cover, our force launched 6 strikes on the enemy with 8 hours, all of which failed to drived the enemy away from the highland.\nEarly 28 morning, the enemy launched an unresultful counter-strike with covers of cannon firing.\nFrom Octboer 28 until Nov 6, the control ot the highland was transferred back and forth a few times, but there weren't decisive results for both sides.\nNight Nov 6, my force was replaced by a friendly one which would take on our duties due to the severe headcount loss of more than 70%.\nSummary of Battle:\nThe loss of my force was predominantly done by close-range fire. This, for one, proves the defense insights about indirect fire circulated within the army; for another, it makes the case for the underpreparation of my force with respect to close-range crossfire. Detailed battle review is attached hereafter."

Five artificial moons once adorned the trees. When the moons lighted up, the central giant gorilla statue would be illuminated, attracting the surrounding small gorillas. However, one day, the five moons disappeared. According to my careful search, these 5 artificial moons are left in several places in the Dim Forest. Fortunately, I have brought back one, and the rest four are scattered across the forest:\n<color=#8c7e51>\nThe second moon is lost on a tree stump, located not far north of the Tacet Field in the eastern area of the forest;\nThe third moon is lost in the cave behind the waterfall, situated in the central area of the forest;\nThe fourth moon is lost beneath the fungus-covered waterfall, located in the southeast area of the forest;\nThe fifth moon is lost in an abandoned human camp, situated in the eastern area of the forest.</color>\n        As the Dim Forest is too dangerous, I couldn't bring them all back myself.

Xin Yi led the first step of reconstruction around Chengxiao Mountain, the sleeping place of the magical being.\n\nIn 115 A.

From you on foreign soils I hear no sign.\nWho cries in the chilling wind every night? Stone leaves are proof of love ever cross time.\nHear me, my audience. When the Threnodian war was right settled, a couple grew up together in Qichi Village at the bank of Xingchui River in Central Plains. The boy, named Branch, aged fifteen, was a gallant warrior and an adept swimmer. Unafraid of the Tacet Discords, he led a major victory by commanding a nightly charge against the enemy across the Xingchui River. A young hero he was. The girl, named leaf, aged thirteen, had sharp knowledgement and clear undestanding of the bigger picture. Every decision she made could always lift people out of crises. The two were intimate and helped each other a lot.\nAt that time, there was an ancient tree, with luxuriant branches, standing in central Plains. Huanglong had won a great victory under the shadow thereof, so people thought that was an auspicious place, and wanted to rebuild a new home here, in order to get blessings. When the war stopped, the two should have been free, but instead they took on this matter. Leaf said: \"Although the war is gone, but the hearts of the people are still concerned. If the ancient wood can give solace, it may be a good cause. I decide to go with them and for help.\" Soon she farewelled Branch. The two since lived in two places, each helping rebuild a village. The good part is that their correspondence carried on and their relationship sustained. A poem described them:\nThe sky's high, leaves reaching it; the land's far, roots connect it.\nLeaf and his party arrived at the outskirts of the ancient tree, and then proceeded to perform civil engineering. The villagers wanted to get the blessing of the tree, so they named the village after name of the tree, Devno, meaning to develop novol lands, and to say goodbye to the old. One day, a villager suddenly found a strange leaf. The leaf was so new with no signs of drying, but white and green patterns intertwined. The villagers were happy: \"It must be a response from Devno, a sign of rewarding us. Let me now find a small table, presented at home, so I can always feel the blessing of Devno.\" The rest of the villagers, if they found this leaf, also followed suit. A poem had it:\nLeaves grow with green and white; hearts filled with anxiety and yearning.\nMay the omen be always there; and bless them with lasting fortune.\nA few days later, a strange disease broke out in the village. The patients would suffer at night, with their body feeling strange pain, as if heavy hammers were beating them, or swords cutting their flesh. Even stranger, they would say they hear sad cries, like yells or howls, incessantly. The sick would be caught in depression, weakness within five days of falling sick. The people then said: \"At that time, we built the village neighboring the great tree in the wish that Devno would bless us, and its branches and leaves extend our lives. Today, my life is not long, so it must be Devno's notification to us; My hearing of lamentation at night must be the great tree's cry for help!\" The villagers all thought that was true.They looked in retrospect and found themselves cut many trees when the village was built, which might bring karma to them. Therefore they prohibited cutting trees again."
